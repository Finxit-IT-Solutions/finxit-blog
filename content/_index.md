Hey, I'm Christian, a Freelance Software Engineer and Software Architect, from Linz, Austria ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹. I do all sorts of stuff with computers, you know those things with the code and the bits and the blinking light.

In this blog, I share my experiences while helping my customers. Or I'm just fiddling around with new shiny tech stuff. Sometimes both at the same time.
