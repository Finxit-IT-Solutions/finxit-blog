title: 'What difference does LeetCode make in your hiring process?'

Everything. You will miss out on good developers based on stupid, non-business related coding challenges. There I said it: doing LeetCode challenges in your hiring process is stupid.

I never experienced a company doing that here in Austria, for me, that was mostly an American thing so far. But there is a first time for everything. I recently interviewed for a new project and they gave me three "coding challenges". No biggie, I have done coding challenges before. However, what I did not expect where the following three tasks:

- Write an algorithm, that generates all possible parentheses combinations.
- Implement your own linked list.
- Implement your own binary search.

And all of that in 60 minutes.

## Parentheses madness

All combinations of parentheses obviously required dynamic programming. And while I'm a vivid [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) enjoyer, this is not something I ever needed in my professional work. Recursion is hard, especially under time pressure. And I absolutely failed the challenge.

## The linked list to rule them all

The next one was about implementing your own linked list. Again something I never needed in any of my professional work. I know how a linked list work, [there is already one in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.linkedlist-1?view=net-9.0), but implementing your own? Am I interviewing at Microsoft or at an insurance company? The last time I implemented my own linked list was probably back in high school/college*, so around 10 years ago. I was able to do some parts, but ran out of time.

_*Special Austrian version of school called HTL_

## The binary search

The day I need a binary search at work will be a glorious day. Because so far, I didn't. I mean, I know how a binary search works: requires ordered list, splits the list repeatedly in half, very efficient. But implementing your own? As I ran out of time during the second task, I didn't even start this one. And there are again inbuilt functions in C# for [Lists](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1.binarysearch?view=net-9.0) and [Arrays](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array.binarysearch?view=net-9.0). This is not something you usually do in your professional work.

## The aftermath

So far? None. Directly after the coding challenge (which I did alone), they collected the notebook with the code on it and I had a technical interview with their Head of IT. And that interview was great, because guess what, I'm a good software developer. But the coding challenge really let the imposter syndrome kick in. I felt so bad, that I actually apologized to the interviewer about it, because I was that bad at it. And honestly, if you make people feel like that, because of coding challenges that have nothing to do with your day-to-day job, then you are just a bad person/company.

## Useful coding challenges

As mentioned in the intro, I have done coding challenges in the past. Write an API controller, query from the database, write a middleware for ASP.NET Core. You know, useful stuff, things that you will actually encounter in your job as a software developer. In my time as a tech lead in my last project, I never did coding challenges, but I can see the point of proving that one, in fact, can write code.

So yeah, do those challenges, if you have to. I have build big and small systems, successfully delivered projects on time. But I'm not grinding LeetCode challenges in my free time.
